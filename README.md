# Sorting algorithms in Rust

Various sorting algorithms implemented in Rust.

# How to use this?

This is a library crate, not a binary crate, which means there is no executable as output.

You could import it as dependency in your Cargo.toml file if you wanted to, since all sorting algorithms are exposed as modules. However, since this is my private implementation of things, you are probably better off using some more official library to do that (or the standard library for that matter), as things are most likely better tested and more efficiently implemented than here.

You can always however read the code and run the unit tests via `cargo test`.
